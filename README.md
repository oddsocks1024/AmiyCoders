# AmiyCoders
## Summary

AmiyCoders contains a yEnc encoder (AmiyEnc) and a yEnc decoder (AmiyDec) for
the Amiga. At the time it was written, it was the only natively available
encoder and decoder for AmigaOS. It is able to handle single part and multi
part encodings, with or without CRC32 checksums and whether or not the encoding
is embedded.

yEnc is an encoding method which offers efficient and proper transmission of
binaries over Usenet, Email and similar media. It is similar in principle to
Base64 or UUencode but is usually more efficient because of various tricks it
employs. 

Originally written under a custom licence, AmiyCoders is now available under
the GPL v2, which supercedes any previous licencing.
